      <h5>CHEMBRA PEAK</h5>
      <P>Chembra is the highest peak in Wayanad district and lives up to its billing of being a picturesque location. It has managed to maintain its pristine nature over the years.

    <h5>MEENMUTTY WATERFALLS</h5>
    <p>Imagine water crashing onto the ground from over 1,000 ft. in three separate levels while an entire rainforest plays its role as the patient, supporting audience. This and much more await you at Meenmutty Falls, one among Wayanadâ€™s delightful treasures. It can be only accessed after an arduous 2 km jungle trek, the visuals on display at the summit are worth the effort. One has separate viewing points for each of the three decks of the waterfalls and due to its location this is one of the few natural wonders in the world that can be experienced in near seclusion. You feel at ease, while the lush greenery gently washes away all that ails your soul, as the roaring water gently soothes your senses. A masterpiece, the waterfalls lie on the Ooty route in Wayanad.</p>

      <h5>EDAKKAL CAVES</h5>
      <P>A trip to Edakkal Caves is like a journey into our forgotten past. Located 10 kms from Sulthan Bathery, they have provided historians with great information regarding the lives and habits of our ancestors. The caves are two natural rock formations believed to have been formed by a large split in a huge rock. The carvings inside are extremely beautiful. A trek up the majestic Ambukuthi Hills is required to reach these caves. The aroma of coffee stays with you the entire way. It is truly a surreal experience as we step into the palms of history.</P>
